##### 16.30.28 Describe the standard overhead joining procedure, and state when it should be used. AIP AD**

***AD 1.6-6***

***5.1 Standard Overhead Join Procedure***
*5.1.1 The standard overhead joining procedure, which is depicted in Figure AD 1.6-1C, should be followed at unattended aerodromes (where no aerodrome control or AFIS is provided) and at other aerodromes when a pilot is unfamiliar with the aerodrome or is uncertain of circuit traffic. The standard overhead joining procedure is a means of compliance with CAR 91.223(a)(2), which requires a pilot to conform with or avoid the aerodrome traffic circuit formed by other aircraft. This procedure is used to determine the runway-in-use and the position of traffic in order to sequence safely. It does not presume a right of way over existing circuit activity.*

***5.1.2 The following procedures should be followed by pilots:***
*(a) If the aircraft is RTF equipped, advise aerodrome traffic of joining intentions.*
*(b) Approach the aerodrome by descending or climbing to 1500 ft or above aerodrome elevation. If a circuit height other than 1000 ft is specified on the aerodrome chart, join at not less than 500 ft above circuit height, or if applicable, the specified joining altitude.*
*(c) Pass over the aerodrome (keeping it on your left) in order to observe wind, circuit traffic and any ground signals displayed in order to establish the runway-in-use and sequence safely; if these cannot be fully ascertained, continue (wings level) to a point beyond the circuit area (approx. 2 NM) and turn left to return to the aerodrome at or above the joining height as specified in (b) to reassess circuit direction.*
*(d) Once the conditions in (c) are ascertained and the circuit direction is established, position on the non-traffic side to descend to circuit height to enter the circuit, making all subsequent turns in the direction of the traffic circuit.*
*(e) Turn 90° across wind and pass sufficiently close to the upwind end of the runway to ensure that aircraft taking off can pass safely underneath.*
*(f) Turn to join the downwind leg of the traffic circuit at a point that ensures adequate spacing with any aircraft in the circuit ahead or behind.*
*(g) High performance aircraft taking off, or aircraft in a go around/missed approach, caution joining traffic crossing upwind threshold at circuit height from non-traffic side.*
*5.1.3 An ATC clearance is required prior to carrying out this procedure at controlled aerodromes*

*(e) For the purpose of paragraph (d), an overtaking aircraft is an aircraft that approaches another from the rear on a line forming less than 70 degrees with the plane of symmetry of the latter.*
*(f) A pilot of an aircraft in flight or on the surface must—*
	*(1) give way to any aircraft that is in the final stages of an approach to land or is landing; and*
	*(2) when the aircraft is one of 2 or more heavier-than-air aircraft approaching an aerodrome for the purpose of landing, give way to the aircraft at the lower altitude; and*
	*(3) not take advantage of right-of-way under subparagraph (2) to pass in front of another aircraft, which is on final approach to land, or overtake that aircraft.*
*(g) A pilot of an aircraft must not take off if there is an apparent risk of collision with another aircraft.*
*(h) A pilot of an aircraft taxiing on the manoeuvring area of an aerodrome must—*
	*(1) give way to aircraft landing, taking off, or about to take off; and*
	*(2) when 2 aircraft are approaching head on, or nearly so, stop or, where practicable, alter course to the right so as to keep well clear of the other aircraft; and*
	*(3) when 2 aircraft are on a converging course, give way to other aircraft on the pilot’s right; and*
	*(4) when overtaking another aircraft, give way and keep well clear of the aircraft being overtaken.*

	*(1) is clearly illuminated; or*
	*(2) has lighted position lights; or*
	*(3) is in an area that is marked by obstruction lights.*

	*(d) between VFR flights, except at controlled aerodromes when defined runway and wake turbulence separations are applicable. (Within the circuit at controlled aerodromes, an aerodrome control service is provided in which instructions, clearances and information are issued to VFR flights to prevent collisions and to achieve defined runway and wake turbulence separation.)*
	*(e) between a flight known to be responding to a TCAS RA, or a GPWS or TAWS alert, and other flights where separation is normally provided as listed above. When the pilot advises “Clear of conflict”, ATC will make every endeavour to restore standard separation and an orderly flow of traffic.

*9.5.4 Aircraft on reciprocal tracks outside of radar cover may be requested to report sighting and passing other aircraft, by day or night, in order to permit a reduction in longitudinal separation. It is the pilot’s responsibility to ensure correct identification of other aircraft. If pilots are unwilling to accept the application of this separation standard, they should not acknowledge the sighting and passing of other traffic.*

***Lateral Separation***
*9.5.5 Aircraft are considered to be laterally separated provided their positions along track are outside an area known as the area of conflict. The area of conflict is established by applying the navigation tolerance for the navigation aid being used for track guidance, plus a buffer area, to the two tracks. The point at which the buffer areas cease to overlap is termed the lateral separation point and is normally expressed as a distance from a navigation aid or reference point.*
*9.5.6 If a distance reference is not available, entry to, or exit from an area of conflict may be determined by radar, or by the passage of an aircraft over:*
	*(a) a point beyond the lateral separation point determined by a radio navigation aid; or*
	*(b) a point beyond the lateral separation point determined by visual reference. (Available during hours of daylight only.)*
*9.5.7 When two aircraft will enter an area of conflict, action will be taken by ATC in sufficient time to ensure that vertical or longitudinal separation exists before the second aircraft passes the lateral separation point on its route. Should doubt exist that an aircraft can reach its assigned altitude before lateral separation is lost, the pilot must confirm the ability to meet the terms of their clearance.*

***Radar Separation***
*9.5.8 Radar separation is detailed in ENR 1.6 paragraph 3.13. Wake turbulence separation is detailed in AD 1.7 paragraph 1.3.*

***Geographical Separation***
*9.5.9 Geographical separation is achieved by requiring one or more aircraft, which are operating by visual reference, to follow tracks identified by prominent geographical features, landmarks or visual reporting points, or to remain within specified CTR/CTA sectors, which have been determined as being geographically separated from other tracks or procedures. Geographical separation may be applied within terminal control areas and CTR up to 6000 ft AMSL.*
*9.5.10 Navigating by visual reference in order to achieve geographical separation requires aircraft to use Visual Navigation Charts or an electronic equivalent. For flights when either a visual departure or visual approach might be anticipated appropriate visual navigation charts or an electronic equivalent should be carried.*
